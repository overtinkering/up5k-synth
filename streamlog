	Progress on the power supply
20210701
	Happy Canada day
	Started layout of the board
	Fixed pads of SD card connector
20210628
	Restarted PCB layout w/ new buttons
	Tomorrow, replacing stream w/ interface meeting on Discord!
20210624
	TIL about hierarchical sheets in KiCAD
	Did the footprint for the PB86 switches
	Did the symbole for the LED driver
20210622
	Worked a bit on the layout
	Added I2C screen
	Things are going well I think....
20210621
	Added pull-down on rotary encoder switch
	Scaled the board to 250x100mm (can scale down later)
	Started playing with layout
20210610
	Added power switch
	Added battery monitor IC
	Got some good news on the FSRs
20210609
	Added some LEDs
	Need to rework the PS design for battery monitoriing
	Need about 23 push buttons for the interface
	Removed the ac coupling on op-amp input stage as suggested by vmttmv
20210607
	Finished the op-amp part of the design.
20210604
	Did symbole for digital pot.
	Made a bit of progress on the analog backend.
	Ale found a project that ported the Arduino to our MCU (https://github.com/Teknic-Inc)
20210603
	Reviewed headphones/line in/out levels and 3.3Vpp should be within spec
	Next stream finish analog backend
20210602
	Gotta check my audio

20210531
	Got raided by Bynaris! Thanks again Bynaris!!
	Did the symbols and footprints for the audio jack and the rotary encoders
	Overtinkerer proved that silly putty w/ graphite powder could be good enough for prototyping.
20210528
	Switched to larger page for schematic as A4 format was too cramped
	Added some pull-ups to the SD card interface ;)
	Got raided by @dearYashica! Thanks Yashica!!!
	Got told to chill out by my viewers... need to make sure the design is good.
20210525
	Started a bit of layout
	Tried my hand at SD Card holder footprint (not pretty)
	Had a discussion on conductive filaments and 3D printers w/ alelondon and Blind_via
	Keypads interface likely to be resistive.
20210518
	Added RESET pin
	Selected SPI interface
	Had a good laugh with the Errata
	Need a plan for the encoders
20210517
	Finished MCU symbol.
	Need to add the connectors, connect the MII interface to the FPGA
20210507
	Revised the FX2 to UP5K if connections due to RGB pins eing open-drain
	While not commited, we're going to add a PMOD wired like the iceSugar
	Find PMOD "specification" `https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/pmod/start`
20210506
	Made the FX2LP to UP5K connections
	Dropped the R-2R ladder in favor of a PMOD connector
	Next on the list is SPI connections, the PMODs, audio if and a small display
20210505
	Made a decision on the interfaces:
	same as semi-final.
	Did prelim routing: see prelim_route.jpg
	Next stream we connect the pins in the schematic
	Next stream to review FPGA IOs assignment as vmttmv pointed out that UP5K has horrible IO arrangement.
20210504
	Still more debate on the interfaces.
	Semi-final decision is the following:
		buttons and LEDs to be multiplexed through SRs
		Cutting half the FX2LP to FPGA data bus
		bit banging SPI 
20210503
	Debated how best to configure the FPGA and interface the FX2LP. Still a bit uncertain, but bit banging w/ the FX2LP seems inevitable.
	alelondon pointed me to glip.io as a framework for communication interface from host to FPGA.
	Tomorrow, we'll do the design on the interfacing.
20210429
	Worked on the power distribution part of the schematic. Still need a good KiCad tutorial
	Missing the analog portion of our DAC and a good UI on the board
	Next will be the MCU/FPGA interface
20210428
	Progressed on the schematic
	Need to look into KiCad tutorial for symbol and schematic entry
	Maybe look into better libraries and footprints too
20210427
	Done the core of parts library. Missing passive discrete components
	Continued discussion about synth interface w/ alelondon (Linnstrument, willowISP's The Wisp, laptop track pads, silicone keypad?)
	Starting schematic capture
20210426
	Created the symbols for Cypress FX2LP, TPS, BQ
	Talked a bit about screens, capacitve touchscreens, conductive silicone keypads
	Traded a few ideas with streamer Third_Tier_Gaming about a DIY StreamDeck
20210423
	Have to think about Human device interface.
	We'll bounce ideas for the board: `https://pad.lamyne.org/gatin00b#`
	We talked about why the FPGA should NEVER be driving a clock to a peripheral.

    research on issues around cypress FX2LP Power circuit 

       Implementing an SPI Master on EZ-USB/FX2LP https://www.cypress.com/file/125791/download

    SD card on SPI doesn't need licensing


    Considering RPi Pico as power/ MCU . main downside is we sacrifice some undetermined latency.
