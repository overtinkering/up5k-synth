	Revised the FX2 to UP5K if connections due to RGB pins eing open-drain
	While not commited, we're going to add a PMOD wired like the iceSugar
	Find PMOD "specification" `https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/pmod/start`
20210506
	Made the FX2LP to UP5K connections
	Dropped the R-2R ladder in favor of a PMOD connector
	Next on the list is SPI connections, the PMODs, audio if and a small display
20210505
	Made a decision on the interfaces:
	same as semi-final.
	Did prelim routing: see prelim_route.jpg
	Next stream we connect the pins in the schematic
	Next stream to review FPGA IOs assignment as vmttmv pointed out that UP5K has horrible IO arrangement.
20210504
	Still more debate on the interfaces.
	Semi-final decision is the following:
		buttons and LEDs to be multiplexed through SRs
		Cutting half the FX2LP to FPGA data bus
		bit banging SPI 
20210503
	Debated how best to configure the FPGA and interface the FX2LP. Still a bit uncertain, but bit banging w/ the FX2LP seems inevitable.
	alelondon pointed me to glip.io as a framework for communication interface from host to FPGA.
	Tomorrow, we'll do the design on the interfacing.

	Worked on the power distribution part of the schematic. Still need a good KiCad tutorial
	Missing the analog portion of our DAC and a good UI on the board
	Next will be the MCU/FPGA interface
20210428
	Progressed on the schematic
	Need to look into KiCad tutorial for symbol and schematic entry
	Maybe look into better libraries and footprints too
20210427
	Done the core of parts library. Missing passive discrete components
	Continued discussion about synth interface w/ alelondon (Linnstrument, willowISP's The Wisp, laptop track pads, silicone keypad?)
	Starting schematic capture
20210426
	Created the symbols for Cypress FX2LP, TPS, BQ
	Talked a bit about screens, capacitve touchscreens, conductive silicone keypads
	Traded a few ideas with streamer Third_Tier_Gaming about a DIY StreamDeck
20210423
	Have to think about Human device interface.
	We'll bounce ideas for the board: `https://pad.lamyne.org/gatin00b#`
	We talked about why the FPGA should NEVER be driving a clock to a peripheral.

       Implementing an SPI Master on EZ-USB/FX2LP https://www.cypress.com/file/125791/download

    SD card on SPI doesn't need licensing


    Considering RPi Pico as power/ MCU . main downside is we sacrifice some undetermined latency.
