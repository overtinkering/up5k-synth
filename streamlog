	Worked on the power distribution part of the schematic. Still need a good KiCad tutorial
	Missing the analog portion of our DAC and a good UI on the board
	Next will be the MCU/FPGA interface
20210428
	Progressed on the schematic
	Need to look into KiCad tutorial for symbol and schematic entry
	Maybe look into better libraries and footprints too
20210427
	Done the core of parts library. Missing passive discrete components
	Continued discussion about synth interface w/ alelondon (Linnstrument, willowISP's The Wisp, laptop track pads, silicone keypad?)
	Starting schematic capture
20210426
	Created the symbols for Cypress FX2LP, TPS, BQ
	Talked a bit about screens, capacitve touchscreens, conductive silicone keypads
	Traded a few ideas with streamer Third_Tier_Gaming about a DIY StreamDeck
20210423
	Have to think about Human device interface.
	We'll bounce ideas for the board: `https://pad.lamyne.org/gatin00b#`
	We talked about why the FPGA should NEVER be driving a clock to a peripheral.

       Implementing an SPI Master on EZ-USB/FX2LP https://www.cypress.com/file/125791/download

    SD card on SPI doesn't need licensing


    Considering RPi Pico as power/ MCU . main downside is we sacrifice some undetermined latency.
